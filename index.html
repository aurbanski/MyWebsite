            Description
          </h2>
          <p>
            My name is Alexander Urbanski and I'm a junior at the University of
            Colorado, Boulder (a.k.a The Harvard of the Rockies). I major in computer
            science and have a strong passion for web development as well as data
            analytics. I switched my major after studying Mechanical Engineering
            for 2.5 years, and I plan to graduate in May 2019.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In my free time I love to watch sports. I'm an Ohio sports fan who
            enjoys watching the Cleveland Browns, Cavaliers, and Indians. I also
            like to play basketball, go to the gym, and watch TV. Some of my favorite
            TV shows are Sherlock, Game of Thrones, and Top Chef. I also like to spend
            time with friends hanging out and eating food.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            All of my personal interests can be also be used as special skills
            in an office environment. Office basketball league? My two years of
            JV basketball will come in handy. Need someone to lift up and replace
            the water cooler jug? These muscles aren't just for show. Need someone
            to talk to around said water cooler? I keep up with all major sporting
            events and Game Of Thrones.
